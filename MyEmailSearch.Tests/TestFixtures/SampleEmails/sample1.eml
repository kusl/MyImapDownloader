Hi Bob,

Here's the update on our Q4 project progress. We've made significant headway on the Kafka integration and the message broker system is now fully operational.

Key achievements:
- Completed Kafka cluster setup
- Implemented event streaming
- Performance testing shows 10x improvement

Let me know if you have any questions.

Best,
Alice
